#READ ME for Jump Table

In this program, I created a Jump Table data structure that visualized a Stack, Queue, and List. In the program, a menu prompts allowing the user to manipulate the three data structures. 
After any changes have been made, the changes will be saved and stored until requested again. The Jump Table creates three different states for all three data structures. 
First a "Enter ( Data Structure Name ) State Method" where the program will read from the directed file and upload the contents into the particular data structure. 
Then a (" Stay (Data Structure Name ) State Method" displays and gives the user a menu that allows them to manipulate the structure however they please & allows the user to save and move to a different structure. 
Lastly, the final state is called the "Exit ( Data Structure Name ) State Method", this method writes the changes onto the directed file and saves the changes that were done.
To properly use this visualization, there are commands for each data structure that automatically commits to changes that are requested. For example, the stack structure has actions called "pop" or "push"
If the first keyword is "pop" you will need to add a character following the keyword to delete that character from the stack. If the keyword is "push" then type in a character of choice to 
add to the data structure. 

- EXAMPLE for push:
push j

- pop EXAMPLE:
pop j
